Hey! We're predicting pedestrian counts in NYC subway stations.

We construct a graphical representation of NYC's subway system and apply a Deep Spatio-Temporal Graphical Convolution Networks (DSTGCN) to predict subway station pedestrian count. 

This regression task relies on multi-modal data, such as NYC turnstile and transfer counts and hourly weather data.
